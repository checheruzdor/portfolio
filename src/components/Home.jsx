            Responsive website design is essential for providing a seamless user
            experience across devices. React.js, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS are
            key technologies used to create responsive websites. React.js allows
            for the creation of reusable UI components, while JavaScript can
            manipulate HTML and CSS to adjust layout and behavior based on
            screen size. HTML/CSS provide the fundamental building blocks for
            structuring and styling web content. By combining these
            technologies, developers can create responsive websites that adapt
            to any screen size or device.
